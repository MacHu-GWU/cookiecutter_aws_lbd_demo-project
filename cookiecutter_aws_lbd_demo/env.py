"""
Deployment environment detection: which environment (dev, tst, prd) this project targets.

A single code base usually deploys the same stacks to several environments.
Instead of reading ``os.environ`` in every module, code asks the module-level
:data:`env` singleton, so the detection rule lives in one place::

    from .env import env

    if env.current_env_name == "prd":
        ...

The value is computed on first access and cached, so importing this module
has no side effect.
