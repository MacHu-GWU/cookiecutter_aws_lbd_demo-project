"""
The ``One`` class: a single entry point to every project-level singleton.

Instead of importing ``env``, ``runtime``, the config, and the boto session from
four places, code imports ``one`` and reads ``one.env``, ``one.runtime``,
``one.config``, ``one.boto_ses``, and so on. Everything environment specific
(``one.config``, ``one.bsm``, ``one.stack_ctx_enum``, ``one.stack_enum``) belongs to
the current environment, ``one.env.current_env_name``, set by ``ENV_NAME``.

**Why mixins:** each concern lives in its own numbered module (``one_01_config.py``,
``one_02_boto_ses.py``, ...), so a reader looking for "how is the boto session
built?" opens one short file. The number gives the dependency order: config comes
before the session, the session before anything that calls AWS. All mixins share
``self``, so a property in one mixin reads another's (``self.config``,
``self.boto_ses``) without any wiring.

**To add a concern:** create ``one_0N_xxx.py`` with a ``OneXxxMixin`` class whose
properties are ``@cached_property``, then add the mixin to the bases of :class:`One`.

Every property is computed on first access, so importing ``one`` does no work and
makes no AWS call. The same ``one`` runs inside Lambda; the devops and cdk
mixins import their dev-only dependencies lazily.
