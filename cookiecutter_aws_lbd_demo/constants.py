Glob patterns of the package files deployed as Lambda source code, see
:func:`~cookiecutter_aws_lbd_demo.one.one_03_devops.build_lambda_source`.
Add ``"*.json"`` and so on when the functions read data files next to the code.

Patterns are matched with ``PurePath.match``, which anchors at the end of the
path relative to the package folder, so ``"*.py"`` matches at any depth.

Glob patterns of the package files never deployed: dev-only code (``cdk/``
needs ``aws_cdk``, which is not in the layer). ``*`` matches one path part only,
so ``"tests/*"`` does not exclude ``tests/sub/x.py``; add a pattern per depth,
as for ``cdk/``. ``tests/one/test_one_one_03_devops.py`` checks the result.
