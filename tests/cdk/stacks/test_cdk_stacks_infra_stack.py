"""
Synth smoke test of the infra stack: create it through ``StackEnum``, the way
``cdk/cdk_app.py`` does, and synthesize it. Passing means the constructs, names,
and cross-stack references are wired up; what each resource looks like is not
checked here (the names are checked in ``tests/config/test_config_config_01_name.py``).
